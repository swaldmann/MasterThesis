\section{Analysis}

TODO: Finish.\\

\textbf{Note to Prof. Moerkotte}: there's not a lot of analysis regarding \texttt{DPccp} itself that hasn't been done in \cite{moerkotte2009building} or \cite{moerkotte2006analysis} before, so I don't think I necessarily have to do (a lot of) benchmarking. My implementation is very/sufficiently fast though (ca. 2.5 ms on my local computer for the ``Moerkotte 2018'' query graph), \textit{including} generating the JSON output, i.e. one server request.\\

My ideas for this chapter (probably rather short though):
\begin{itemize}
    \item How can other algorithms be visualized with this toolset (I also tested it for \texttt{DPsize})? 
    \item What steps have to be taken to visualize other (join ordering) algorithms, such as \texttt{GOO} (We can already show cardinalities/selectivities, for the cost function)? 
    \item How can the toolset be extended in general?
    \item Can the toolset be applied to other domains?
    \item When is the output too large to create a meaningful visualization (too many steps)?
    \item Qualitative research as to how effective algorithm visualizations are pedagocically (?)
\end{itemize}
