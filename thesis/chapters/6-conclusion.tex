\section{Conclusion}

\subsection{Summary}

Supports higher level drawings of datastructures to a degree where algorithms like DPCCP and Adaptive Radix Trees can be declaratively visualized.

\subsection{Future Work}

It could be possible that explicitly giving a \texttt{graphType} parameter to the \texttt{drawQueryGraph} method of the client is not necessary. This would however require us to infer the graph type from the relation's connections themselves.
