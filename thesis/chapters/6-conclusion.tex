\section{Conclusion}

\subsection{Summary}

Supports higher level drawings of datastructures to a degree where algorithms like DPCCP can be declaratively visualized.

while hiding details of the visualization implementation itself.
To be precise, all algortihms containing on a query graph with disjoint observed relations can be visualized.

\subsection{Future Work}

Multi-color support for nodes.

It could be possible that explicitly giving a \texttt{graphType} parameter to the \texttt{drawQueryGraph} method of the client is not necessary. This would however require us to infer the graph type from the relation's connections themselves.
