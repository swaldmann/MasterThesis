\section{Conclusion}

\subsection{Summary}

TODO: Finish.

\begin{itemize}
    \item Supports higher-level drawings of datastructures to a degree where algorithms like DPCCP can be declaratively visualized while hiding details of the visualization implementation itself. To be precise, all algortihms containing on a query graph with disjoint observed relations can be visualized.
\end{itemize}





\subsection{Future Work}

TODO: Finish.

\begin{itemize}
    \item Multi-color support for nodes
    \item It could be possible that explicitly giving a \texttt{graphType} parameter to the \texttt{drawQueryGraph} method of the client is not necessary. This would however require us to infer the graph type from the relation's connections themselves.
\end{itemize}
